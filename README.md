# Artopia

[Artopia](https://artopia.netlify.app/) is a Web-App that makes art affordable to everyone, enabling more and more people to have artwork in their daily life , and spark interest and curiosity. I created this repository in order to practice and grasp better the concept learned in a course about **Vue**. I utilize multiple concept learned, like *vue-routing* to create a smooth experience for the user while navigating through the website without the need to load the different pages every single time, *vuex* to centralize all the data in one place and allowing the different parts of the website to keep updated simultaneously and *components* to have a reusable and custom element throughout the entire web-app.
